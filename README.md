### EasyLocationUtility

##### An abstraction layer for the Google Play Services FusedLocationProviderClient API

Provides a simple to use wrapper for some of the more common location-related tasks, such as:
- Get the device's last known location
- Get constant location updates (and control the update granularity)
- Get "smart" location (a combination of the above two functions)
- Test if user has granted permission to access the device's fine location and request it if not
- Test if required device setttings are satisfied and request the user enable them if not

See the [documentation](http://www.dmgdesignuk.com/pages/docs/dmglocationutils/index.html) for full details.

### EasyAddressUtility

##### An abstraction layer for Android's Geocoder

Provides a wrapper for some common reverse geocoding tasks, such as:
- Get a List<Address> object containing all the address data associated with a given location
- Get a specific address line for a given location (e.g. street address etc.)

See the [documentation](http://www.dmgdesignuk.com/pages/docs/dmglocationutils/index.html) for full details.

## Adding the library to your project

Add the Jitpack repository to your **root** *build.gradle* file at the end of the repositories section:

```java
	allprojects {
		repositories {
			...
			maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
		}
	}
```

Add the dependency to your **app** *build.gradle* file:

```java
	dependencies {
		implementation 'com.github.DMGDesignUK:DmgLocationUtils:v1.0.1'
	}
```

### Usage

Add the following permission in your Androidmanifest.xml file:
```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"/>
```

The following is a very basic example of how you can implement some of the more common use-cases. For more examples have a look at the source code of the [example app](https://github.com/DMGDesignUK/DmgLocationUtils/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/dmgdesignuk/app/MainActivity.java), which is extensively commented, or read the full Javadoc [here](http://www.dmgdesignuk.com/pages/docs/dmglocationutils/index.html)
```java
    // Create instances of the utilities
    EasyLocationUtility locationUtility = new EasyLocationUtility(this);
    EasyAddressUtility addressUtility = new EasyAddressUtility(this);

    // Check if permission to access device location has been granted and ask for it if not
    if (locationUtility.permissionIsGranted()){
        // Permission is granted
    } else {
        // Permission not granted, ask for it
        locationUtility.requestPermission(EasyLocationUtility.RequestCodes.REQUEST_CODE);
    }

    // Get the device's last known location
    locationUtility.getLastKnownLocation(new LocationRequestCallback() {
        @Override
        public void onLocationResult(Location location) {
            // Location result successfully received. Handle the Location object here.
        }
        @Override
        public void onFailedRequest(String result) {
            // Location request failed. The result string will contain the reason for failure.
        }
    });

    // Get continuous current location updates
    locationUtility.getCurrentLocationUpdates(new LocationRequestCallback() {
        @Override
        public void onLocationResult(Location location) {
            // Location result successfully received. Handle the Location object here.
        }
        @Override
        public void onFailedRequest(String result) {
            // Location request failed. The result string will contain the reason for failure.
        }
    });

    // Get an address element from a location
    String street = addressUtility.getAddressElement(EasyAddressUtility.AddressCodes.STREET_NAME, location);
    String city = addressUtility.getAddressElement(EasyAddressUtility.AddressCodes.CITY_NAME, location);
```
